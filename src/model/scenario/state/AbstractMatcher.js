* A _matcher_ is an object that handles state descriptors, i.e. each key/value pair in a state description object from a Featureâ€™s scenario.
* Implementing a new matcher, i.e. offering a new content comparison type, is very easy: simply extend this class, taking example on the existing concrete matchers, and redefine at least `onElementFound`, calling `this.succeed`, `this.fail` and/or `this.compare`.
