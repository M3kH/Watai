	* A feature description file contains a simple descriptive array listing widget methods to execute and widget state descriptors to assert.
	* More formally, such an array is ordered and its members may be:
	* - a closure;
	* - an object whose keys are some widgets' attributes identifiers (ex: "MyWidget.myAttr"), pointing at a string that contains the expected text content of the HTML element represented by the `myAttr` hook in `MyWidget`.
	*
	* Upon instantiation, a Feature translates this array into an array of promises:
	* - closures are executed directly, either as promises if they are so themselves, or as basic functions;
	* - a widget state describing hash maps each of its members to an assertion inside a promise, evaluating all of them asynchronously.
	* All those promises are then evaluated sequentially upon calling the `test` method of a Feature.
	*
