Watai
=====

Watai (temporary name) is a **declarative, bottom-up BDD, full-stack web testing** framework.

It is both a test runner engine (i.e. it executes tests) and a set of architectural patterns to make you write **maintainable**, **solid** end-to-end (GUI) tests for browsers.

Benefits
--------

1. Creating a safety net to catch regressions.
2. Defining expected behavior and automatically checking its cross-browser consistency.

How to use
----------

### Installing ###

Watai runs as a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) module, and has dependencies on other modules.

You will therefore need the Node runtime, and NPM to manage dependencies, which [comes with Node](http://npmjs.org/doc/README.html#Super-Easy-Install).

_Watai has been tested only with Node 0.6, not yet with 0.8. If you already have Node, you should stick with 0.6 for the moment._

#### Node & NPM ####

Download the Node package for your environment:
- Precompiled for [OS X](http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.6.18/node-v0.6.18.pkg).
- Precompiled for [Windows](http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.6.18/node-v0.6.18.msi).
- Or use a [package manager](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager) to get Node v0.6.
